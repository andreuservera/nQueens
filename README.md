This problem could be solved by trial and error, but given the high amount of possible positions in the chess board, this problem can be approached with different methods. One of these methods is using a **genetic algorithm**.

The first approach is to use a genetic algorithm to solve the problem. However, we want to expand this project by utilizing various methods and to be able to pic the desired method to use. Also, it we want to display some information in the form of graphs using **grafana**.
